    "description": "Create a CSV file with calculations, nested lists, data from connected things, and much more! \n\nWhatever you may need, there is no limit to the data that can be exported using the CSV Creator.\n\nThere are two supported actions:\n\nCREATE CSV FROM JSON\nThis is a standalone action that allows you to quickly create CSV files and allows the user to download them directly to their computer\n\nSEND JSON TO CSV CREATOR\nThis action is available only when the element CSV Creator is placed on your page. This action will return a file to the CSV Creator element which you can then save to your database, email to the user, etc. \n\nThis action also exposes an event called 'A CSV Creator has created your file' which will be triggered anytime a CSV is generated.\n\n<--- HOW TO USE ---> \n\nThis uses the operator :format as text on a list in Bubble. Get started by adding the Create CSV from JSON action to your workflow.\n\nThe File Name field can be set to a static text or you can make it dynamic if you want to save your files by date or user, etc.\n\nNOTE: Generally you will get the option to change the file name before saving the CSV file as well.\n\nThe JSON content field simply needs valid JSON and you are good to go. However, the idea is to do a search for the data you want to export and then use the :format as text operator and create your JSON in that field as shown below.\n\nAdd a comma to the Delimiter field\n\nSample JSON\n\n{\n\"Sale Date\": \"This Sales's Order Date\",\n\"Sale ID\":\"This Sales's Order ID\",\n\"Items\":[\"This Sales's Items\"],\n\"Region\":\"This Sales's Region's Name\"\n}\n\nIf you want to export a nested list, simply add square brackets around the value as shown in the Items value in the JSON sample\n\nCREATE A DYNAMIC CSV FILE\n(note: This action is fully functional but will not be updated further)\n\nThis action is less technical to use but is also more limited than the Create CSV from JSON action. You can use export linked data but are not able to export calculated values.\n\nTo use add the action Create a Dynamic CSV File to your workflow.\n\nFile Name \nThis can be dynamic or you can add static text here.\n\nHeader Fields\nThe header field controls the header text for that column. It also controls whether that column is included in the download. If the header field is empty, the column will be ignored.\n\nNote, the header fields are dynamic. Why does this matter? Hey, give your users the ability to name the columns or choose which columns they want included in their download... tons of options available here.\n\nData \nEnter a dynamic search. Remember that every column should have the same search or your CSV file will be inaccurate. You can use an element such as a repeating group as your data source if it's easier.\n\nSelect a field or select a linked data type and then select a field from that object.\n",
